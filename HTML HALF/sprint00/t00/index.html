    <h2 id="Anchor">What makes a superhero?</h2>
    <p>
        A superhero is a person who does heroic deeds and has the ability
        to do them in a way that a normal person couldn’t. So in order
        to be a superhero, <b>you need a power that is more exceptional than
        any power a normal human being could possess,</b> y and you need to use
        that power to accomplish good deeds. Otherwise, a policeman or a
        fireman could be considered a superhero. <br />For instance, a good guy
        fighting a bad guy could be just a regular police story or detective
        story or human-interest story. But if it’s a good guy with a superpower
        who is fighting a bad guy, it becomes a superhero story. If the good
        guy is doing something that a normal human being couldn’t do, couldn’t
        accomplish, then I assume he becomes a superhero.
